## Storyboard (Round 2)

Delete this line before submission : The core principle of Round 2 is to make the lab/experiment documentation elaborated in a manner that it makes easy for any person (developer/domain and non domain faculty/student) to understand and develop the lab/experiment.

Experiment 1: Name of the Experiment

### 1. Story Outline:

Describe outline Here ( guide : The proposer should first draft the story outline for the proposed outline. This could be 2 or 3 paragraphs.)

### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Describe here : (guide When a user lands up into a simulator, the visual stage is the first thing that user comes across. The visual stage should include all the elements to be seen by a user on an imaginary canvas.  (This should NOT include any drawings. ) )

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
